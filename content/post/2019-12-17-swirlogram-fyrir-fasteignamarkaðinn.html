<h2>Swirlogram</h2>
<p>Mér finnst alltaf gagnlegt að skoða swirlogram. Ég tók fyrst eftir slíku í greiningu hjá Goldman Sachs þegar þeir voru að vinna með eigin útreikninga af leiðandi hagvísi.<br />
Grafið að neðan sýnir swirlogram fyrir íbúðamarkaðinn á höfuðborgarsvæðinu frá árinu 2005. Grafið sýnir að fasteignamarkaðurinn datt í hægagang í upphafi árs 2008 og er þar enn. Nýjustu gildin gefa þó vísbendingu um að þensla gæti farið að myndast.</p>

<h2>Spá</h2>
<p>Fyrir skammtímaspár er hægt að styðjast við ARIMA líkön. VAR líkön eru þó líklegri til að ná betri skammtímaspám. Fyrir langtímaspá er líklegt að VEC líkön muni standa sig best.<br />
Hér mun ég aðeins birta spá með ARIMA líkani. VAR og VEC fá að bíða sem stendur.<br />
Grafið að neðan sýnir spá fyrir janúar 2019 til og með desember 2019. Raunþróun er við neðri mörk 50% spábilsins.</p>

<p>Næst bý ég til líkan fyrir allt gagnasettið og birti spá út næsta ár. Spáin gerir ráð fyrir hækkun á næsta ári og að 50% spábilið verði fyrir ofan núllið nema í nóvember og desember 2020.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-12-17-swirlogram-fyrir-fasteignamarkaðinn_files/figure-html/fit_full-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>Ég sé ekki fyrir mér að fasteignaverð fari lækkandi næsta árið. Það gæti þó verið gagnlegt að styðjast við VAR líkan sem tæki tillit til annarra þátta á borð við vexti, skuldsetningu, leiguverð, laun og fleira. Markaðurinn er í hægagangi sem stendur en lítið þarf til að þenslu merki fari að myndast. Ýmislegt ófyrirséð getur þó haft mikil áhrif, svo sem Brexit eða kreppa í Þýskalandi.</p>
